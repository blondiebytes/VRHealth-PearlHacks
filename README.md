# VRHealth-PearlHacks: The Magic School Bus

A journey inside the heart that shows the potential for using virtual reality in the doctor's office and the classroom.

##What it does
Ever wanted to know what's really happening inside your body when your sick? See how your lifestyle choices impact your anatomy with newly developing virtual reality technology. We used a Oculus Rift headset and Leap Motion technologies within Unity to allow a patient to take a tour of the human heart. Integrating Leap Motion allows the user to move freely throughout the body and observe the differences between a healthy and unhealthy organ with simple hand gestures.

##Challenges we ran into
Integrating leap motion into Unity alongside Oculus proved to be a new challenge since this was our first experience using virtual reality technology. We also discovered that much of the virtual reality software is built for Windows, rather than Mac (which we were using).

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting to build something on Unity, putting on the Oculus headset, and experiencing it in 3D was exciting. Also using Leap Motion to travel through the body was a challenge to set-up, but very rewarding once we got it to work. We learned that because virtual reality software is meant for Windows machines, we should borrow AlienWare hardware or a windows machine from MLH to build a VR project.

##What's next for The Magic School Bus
We open sourced the project so that future developers and educators could add more health related VR experiences through the body. We hope that this might be a new tool for students that integrates biology with computer science. In the future, we hope to construct a full body experience so that a user can explore various organs customized to their disease or condition.

##Contributions
Kathryn Hodge: Personally integrated Oculus and Leap Motion into Unity and extended heart modeling to include plaque. Wrote C# scripts that allow the user to move throughout the scene with point gestures and take away / restore plaque with just a swipe of the hand.
